    <h2>Section One</h2>
    <p>Computer programming is the process of performing particular computations (or more generally, accomplishing
      specific computing results), usually by designing and building executable computer programs. Programming
      involves
      tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
      implementation of algorithms (usually in a particular programming language, commonly referred to as
      coding).[1][2]
      The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather
      than
      machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. To produce machine code, the source
      code
      must either be compiled or transpiled. Compiling takes the source code from a low-level programming language and
      converts it into machine code. Transpiling on the other hand, takes the source-code from a high-level
      programming
      language and converts it into bytecode. This is interpreted into machine code. The purpose of programming is to
      find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an
      operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires
      expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms,
      and formal logic.</p>

    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer
      was
      invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of
      Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a
      musical
      mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[6][7] In
      1801,
      the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" ‚Äì a series of pasteboard
      cards
      with holes punched in them.</p>
